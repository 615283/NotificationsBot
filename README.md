# NotificationsBot
Discord bot for notifications. Use this bot and config is self explanatory.

# Hosting
I do not host this bot for you at this time, I might another time, but right now, you have to. Sorry, but I don't have infinite servers.

# What does it do?
This bot does not provide notifications, webhooks can do that. The bot opts people in and out of a role, which you should give permissions to a specific channel. More updates coming soon. (You have to create the role yourself btw)

# Code usage
If you want to edit this code, I don't care but please inform me via idk how but that will be here soon. Give me credit for original code, but do what you want.
